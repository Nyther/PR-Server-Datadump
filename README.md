# PR-Server-Datadump
##                  ! ATTENTION !
This file must be written in Python 2.7, so no:  
- f-strings
- type hinting


### Usage:
Copy import statement below:
```py
import serverdatadump
serverdatadump.init()
```

Paste it into this file:  
`\Project Reality BF2\mods\pr\python\game\__init__.py`

Make sure it gets imported and initialized after everything else.

And finally, create a "datadump" folder in the PR root.
